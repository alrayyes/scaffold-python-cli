# Contributing

This file is for whoever changes this template. The
[README](README.md) is for whoever stamps a project out of it.

## Getting set up

- **Python 3.13 or newer.**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**. Not installed by default — one-time
  setup:

  ```sh
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

  Confirm it worked with `uv --version`. `uv sync` then creates `.venv`
  and installs everything pinned in `uv.lock`.

- **[bun](https://bun.sh)** for the tooling that isn't Python —
  commitlint, Prettier, markdownlint, and the
  [lefthook](https://lefthook.dev) that runs the git hooks. There's a
  `package.json`, but nothing here is JavaScript; it exists only so those
  tools resolve and stay pinned.
- **[Vale](https://vale.sh) v3.17.1** on your `PATH`, for the style tier
  of the prose lint — a released binary from
  [its releases page](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases/tag/v3.17.1),
  or your package manager's pinned build. The version has to match what
  CI runs, or the hook passes and the pipeline fails for a reason that
  isn't obvious from the failure.

  `ltex-cli-plus` needs nothing installed: the hook fetches and caches it
  on first use.

Two commands install the linters and the git hooks:

```sh
uv sync
bun install
```

An uninstalled hook silently does nothing, which is worse than not having
one, so `bun install`'s `prepare` script runs `lefthook install` for you.
You find out at the pipeline otherwise, not at the commit.

## Everyday commands

Every one of these is what a hook or CI runs — see `lefthook.yml` and
`.github/workflows/*.yml` for exactly which.

```sh
uv run pytest
uv run pytest --cov=scaffold_python_cli --cov-report=term-missing
uv run ruff check          # the linter
uv run ruff check --fix    # its fixer
uv run ruff format         # the formatter; add --check for the check-only form

bun run format:check       # prettier --check, add --write to fix
bun run lint:md
bun run lint:prose         # vale
bun run lint:mechanics     # ltex-cli-plus
```

## How it fits together

`src/scaffold_python_cli/` holds everything importable —
`cli.py` is the [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com) app and its one
example command, `__init__.py` exposes it. No `src/scaffold_python_cli/commands/`
tree: that shape earns its keep the day a second command needs its own
file, not on day one of a template nobody's used yet. Tests live in
`tests/test_cli.py`, driven through `typer.testing.CliRunner` — Typer's
wrapper over Click's own test runner, invoking the command in-process
rather than shelling out.

## Commit messages

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`type(scope): description`, types `feat`/`fix`/`docs`/`style`/`refactor`/
`perf`/`test`/`build`/`ci`/`chore`/`revert`. Subject under 50 characters,
lowercase, no trailing full stop. commitlint enforces the shape at
commit-msg and again in CI; the length and case rules are tighter than
what it checks, so hold to them anyway.

## Branching, review, and release

Every change goes through a pull request — nothing is pushed straight to
`main`, including the bootstrapping that built this repo. GitHub's branch
protection needs a paid plan this account doesn't have, so nothing enforces
that mechanically here; it's discipline, not a gate.

The pull request **title** has to be a valid Conventional Commit too —
`pr-title.yml` checks it. commitlint only ever reads commit objects, and a
squash merge defaults its commit message to the pull request title, so this
is the only check standing between a badly titled pull request and a bad
message on `main`.

Once a pull request's checks are green, squash-merge it and delete the
branch. [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
reads the Conventional Commits on `main` and keeps a release pull request
open with the next version and changelog entry, read from `pyproject.toml`;
merging that one tags the release. Nobody picks a version by hand.
